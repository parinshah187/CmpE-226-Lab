NoSQL vs Relational Database

Advantages of NoSQL Database:
1. NoSQL Database store Semi-structured or unstructured schema. So, no need to be specific about attributes while entering the data.
2. There are no joins in NoSQL Database, so computational overhead is relatively lower.

Disadvantages of NoSQL Database:
1. Performance is relatively lower if structured data is used with NoSQL Database.
2. Performance is relatively lower if there is no attribute available to index records.

Advantages of Relational Database:
1. Used widely and performs efficiently if the data being used is structured.
2. There are various variants available on storage aspect like row-based, columnar database, etc...
3. Performance is relatively high if data is structured


Disadvantages of Relational Database:
1. Relational Database have structured data. So, the user has to be specific while defining schema and the records must be inserted accordingly.
2. If there are multiple tables, then joins may deteriorate performance.
